Trigger Scheduled Events
========================

A WordPress plugin which will allow you to view and trigger any scheduled event right now instead of waiting until WP cron tells it to run. Handy for debugging.

## Use

Install and activate the plugin. Under Tools > Scheduled Events you will have the option to view and trigger any event scheduled with WP Cron.
